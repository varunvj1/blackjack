# About BlackJack
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game where players face off against a dealer. The cards are worth face value, except Aces which is of value 1 or 11, 
and face cards (J, Q, K) which are of value 10. <br>

## How to Play
1. Start the game by pressing the ***HIT*** button.
2. After the first step, you will get a card, and your current score would be calculated and displayed above.
3. Press the HIT button again, to get your 2nd card. Keep geeting more cards until you feel you have reached close to 21 (and not over 21).
4. Then press ***STAND*** button. This would mean that you want to end your turn. The dealer (computer) would choose cards now. 
5. After the dealer's turn is over, the score is compared:
    - If your score is more than dealer, you **WIN**.
    - If your score is less than dealer, you **LOSE**.
    - If you and the dealer gets the same score, then its a **DRAW**.
6. Lastly, click the ***DEAL*** button to play again.
7. Your cumulative wins, losses and draws is saved and displayed on the scoreboard below.
>**Remember:** if during any turn (your's or the dealer's), the score becomes more than 21, then that player will be ***BUSTED*** and thus lose. This would mean an automatic win 
for the other player.
